JRuby/Gradle plugin to manage creating Storm topology jars

== Usage


Including the plugin:

[source, groovy]
----
buildscript {
    repositories { jcenter() }
    dependencies {
        classpath "com.github.jruby-gradle:jruby-gradle-storm-plugin:[0.4.4,0.5)"
    }
}
----


== Creating a topolog .jar

Creating a topology `.jar` file is useflu when you plan on uploading your
topology to a running Storm cluster. *Currently* this plugin will only create
that jar for you, it will not upload it.

 * `./gradlew jrubyStorm` will create a `.jar` in `build/libs/`
